    It has been said that an amateur is defensive. The professional finds learning - and even occassionally being shown up - to be enjoyable; they like being challenged and humbled, and engage in education as an ongoing and endless process. Stay humble because the second you stop being a student, your knowledge becomes fragile. I might even add that the moment you stop learning, you start dying. Again, you cannot swim in new horizons until you have the courge to lose sight of the shore.
