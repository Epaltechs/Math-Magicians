            The professional finds learning-and even occassionally being shown up-to be enjoyable;
            they like being challenged and humbled, and engage in education as an ongoing and endless process.
            Stay humble because the second you stop being a student, your knowledge becomes fragile.
            I might even add that the moment you stop learning, you start dying.
            Again, you cannot swim in new horizons until you have the courge to lose sight of the shore.
